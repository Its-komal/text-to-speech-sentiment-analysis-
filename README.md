# waldo-demo

Waldo is basically a smart artificial intelligence based assistant system with takes user input in the form of an audio or text and revert back to him similar as chatbot. 
It is an advance system which use sentiment analysis to check the intention of the speech given by user and reply accordingly.


The whole idea of this project is to make the life of a receptionist easier. We can use the model in any public premises. When a visitor arrive at the premises.

The system recognise the person using face recognition, if he/ she is a known person the system will greet with their name (Good morning stella) them as the data of known people is already stored in the system. If the person is unknown the system ask the person to input its details via keyboard or show an id to the camera (so all the details are auto capture using OCR).
